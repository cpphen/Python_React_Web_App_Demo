# Line 6 means, when the name of the file being run is 
# __name__, then do everything under 
# this if block. In this case, it will call the main function.
# The reason for this demo is to show that when importing and
# invoking a function from another file, if it is not called
# within a function inside the invoking origin file, python
# will read and execute all code within the file the function
# is being imported from, and not just the function that is 
# being imported and needed. In this file, the imported 
# function `looper` will run but the print statement within
# the same file (loopFunc.py), will not be read and executed.
# This is because the imported file is inside of a function
# main() in THIS file so once the function has been invoked
# and finishes, it continues to read the code in this file
# not the file from which the function was imported.

## This can also be the case for the reverse scenario where the 
# main function is in the same file as the function being imported.
# Consider figure 1 below.

# Figure 1
# 
# originFunc.py
# def printer(i):
# 	print('strawberry cough');
# 	return i;

# for i in range(7):
# 		print("{}".format(printer(i)))

# def main():
# 	for i in range(7):
# 		print("{}".format(printer(i)))

# if __name__ == "__main__":
# 	main();

# importedFunc.py
# from originFunc import printer

# printer("<3")
